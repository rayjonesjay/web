    <!-- html attributes provide additional info about elements 
     1. all html elements can have attributes
     2. attributes provide additional info about elements
     3. attributes are always specified in the start tag
     4. attributes usually come in name/value pairs ie name=value
     the <a> tag defines a hyperlink, the href attribute specifies the url 
      of the page the link goes to.
     -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">visit w3 schools</a>
     
    <!-- the src atrribute, the <img> tage is used to embed an image in an
    html page, the src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed -->

    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/img_girl.jpg">

    <!-- there are two ways to specify the URL in the src atrribute
    1. absolute URL - links to an external image that is hosted on another website example: src="https://www.example.com/my_images/img_food.jpg

    NOTE: external images might be under copyright, if you dont get permission to use it you may be in violation of copyright laws, also you have no control over them, they can be suddenly changed or removed
    
    2.relative URL - links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here the URL does not include the domain name since it is hosted in the domain, if the url does ot begin with a /, it will be relative to the current page. example: src="img.png"... if the url does not begin  with a slash, it will be relative to the domain example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg"

    NOTE it is always best to use relative URLs, they will not break if you change domain
     -->


     <!-- the img tag should also contain the width  and heigh attributes
     which specify the width and heigth of the image (in pixels) -->

     <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="50" height="60">

     <!-- the alt attribute, for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, of the image for some reason cannot be displayed, this is useful when there is a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute , or if user uses a screen reader -->

     <img style="image-orientation: flip;" src="img.jpg" alt="a man eating cake">


     <!-- the style attribute, is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font,size, and more... -->
     <p style="color:red;">This is red</p>
     <p style="font-family:monospace;">This is monospace</p>
